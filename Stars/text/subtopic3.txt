Observations have shown that bigger the star, the smaller the life. At least 70% of the stars present in the Universe are Red dwarves. They are impossible to be seen with a naked eye, as they emit a meager amount of energy and heat. Like all stars, Hydrogen and Helium fuel up the Red Dwarves While other massive stars and giants collect their fused Helium at the core, the Hydrogen and Helium of the Red dwarves mix up, which means the fuel lasts longer. The mixing up of the elements prevents the accumulation of Helium in the core of the star. The build-up is a prerequisite for core helium fusion and commencement of the red giant phase. As there is no Hydrogen left to counter the gravity, the star collapses and heats up to become a white dwarf. They do it so slowly that their average lifespan is in between 1 million and 10 trillion years.Scientists usually have difficulty in distinguishing between red dwarves and brown dwarves. Red and Brown dwarves most likely form in the same way. But Brown dwarves are the ones who never reach the point of fusion because of their small sizes.
