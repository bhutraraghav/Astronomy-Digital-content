Stars don't form in the matter of seconds, minutes or hours. Formation of stars is a process so slow that it can take millions of years in the completion. Stars begin their life-journey in the vast molecular clouds of dust and gas, generally known as nebulae or dark nebulae. The nebulae are usually composed of Hydrogen or Helium along with other materials. The gravitational disturbances within the clouds form into knots that have sufficient mass to collapse under its gravity. These disturbances are caused by a nearby supernova explosion or galactic collision, sending a shockwave of energy through the molecular cloud hence causing the cloud to collapse due to its pull. Hydrogen and Helium in the cloud starts to cluster together in its centre, increasing mass and gravity, also attracting more molecules from the surrounding. As the cloud collapses, the centre material heats up becoming a hot core that later forms a star. The hot base in the middle of the collapsing cloud is known as the protostar. The temperature of the protostar rises to such an extent causing nuclear fusion reaction of Hydrogen creating more Helium, heat, light, and radiation. Now at one point, the inward force of gravity equates to the outward effect of the radiation, thus maintaining a balance. Hence, a star is born. The leftover material from the protostar gets used in to create planets, asteroids etc. that revolve around the central star. These collapsing clouds may break into two or three parts, explaining the binary star systems.
