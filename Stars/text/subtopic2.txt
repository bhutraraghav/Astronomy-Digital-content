After their formation, stars will continue to burn energy and glow for a long time. Which path is followed by the stars in its life journey, depends majorly on the mass or how much gas was collected and collapsed to form the star. During the lifetime, gravity and radiation forces keep the balance, until the Hydrogen runs out.The Hertzsprung - Russell diagram shows that the Main sequence stars classified through a wide range of luminosities and colors. The smallest stars, the Red Dwarfs, are about 10% of the mass of the Sun and emit only 0.01% as much energy. They have a temperature of about 3000K-4000K and by far are the most numerous in the Universe. Their lifespan is about tens of billions of years. Similarly, the Hypergiants are about 100 times more massive than the Sun glowing at about 30000K temperature. Due to the high emission of energy, they lose their fuel quickly and have a lifespan of about a few million years. If the star is sufficiently massive, the collapsing core may become hot enough to support more exotic nuclear reactions that consume Helium and produce a variety of heavier elements up to iron. However, such reactions offer only a reprieve. Gradually, the star's internal nuclear fires become increasingly unstable - sometimes burning furiously, other times dying down. These variations cause the star to pulsate and throw off its outer layers, enshrouding itself in a cocoon of gas and dust. What happens next depends on the size of the core.
